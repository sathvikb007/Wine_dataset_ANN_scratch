The project attmepts to classify wine into either red or white whine by implementing a
simple artificial neural network(ANN) from scratch. 

The dataset is taken from the wine datset on Kaggle. The link is given below:

The ANN has an input layer, one hidden layer with 15 nodes and an output layer.
It utilizes gradient descent with regularization and achieves a training set and
test accuracy of approximately 99% each.

The code is written in Python.
